# Introduction to Syncfusion Flutter Widgets Documentation

The Syncfusion [Flutter Widgets](https://www.syncfusion.com/flutter-widgets) are a set of [advanced custom widgets and file formats packages](https://pub.dev/publishers/syncfusion.com/packages) you ever need to create rich and high-quality cross-platform applications in iOS, Android, and Web from a single code base. This article gives you a quick overview of how to read the Flutter widgets documentation and other help resources such as video tutorials, code examples, demos, and the knowledge base.

## How to best read this user guide

* The best way to read the user guide is to start with the Getting Started section of the documentation for the widget or library that you need. The Getting Started guide gives information needed to know before writing the code. This is the only section recommended for end-to-end reading before writing the code. All the other information can be referred when needed. The widgets catalog section helps you to find its user guide link and its package in [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/publishers/syncfusion.com/packages).
* Now, that you are familiar with the basics of using the widget, and the next step would be to start integrating the library into your application. It is very likely that you would find a code example that resembles your intended usage scenario.
* After you have integrated the component into your application, it is likely that you would need additional information on specific features and API. Search the specific topic using the search box available at the top of the user guide.

## Additional help resources

The user guide itself has enough information to get you up and running. However, there are other valuable resources you must be aware of.
